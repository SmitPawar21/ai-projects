# My AI Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of AI projects that leverage large language models (LLMs) using Python. This repository showcases two innovative applications: a Restaurant Idea Generator and a YouTube Video Summarizer. Each project demonstrates the integration of advanced AI technologies to provide practical solutions.

## Projects

### 1. Restaurant Idea Generator:

This project generates unique restaurant concepts based on user input. By utilizing LLMs, it creates ideas that consider various cuisines, themes, and target audiences, helping aspiring restaurateurs find inspiration.

#### Technologies:
- Python
- LangChain
- OpenAI

### 2. YouTube Video Summarizer

This tool summarizes YouTube videos by extracting key points from the transcripts. It employs the YouTube Transcript API to fetch video content and an LLM to distill the information into concise summaries, making it easier for users to grasp the main ideas without watching the entire video.

#### Technologies:

- Python
- Gemini Pro
- Streamlit
- YouTube Transcript API
